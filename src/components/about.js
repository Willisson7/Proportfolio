      <p>
        My name is Grant and I am an aspiring full-stack developer. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp to beef up my tech skills and create a portfolio of completed projects along the way. I'll be learning JavaScript and React, along with several other languages and developer tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a dream/goal of creating my own personal website, where I can share my thoughts and theories about my favorite subjects and interact with like-minded individuals. Meaningful conversations about important topics are of great interest to me. I believe that there is a little nerd inside all of us just waiting to be valued and appreciated.
